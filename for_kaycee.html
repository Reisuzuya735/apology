        <h1>I wanna apologize for the times I've hurt you or made you feel upset. I know that sometimes I can act in ways that seem rude, and that's the last thing I want to do, especially to someone as kind and understanding as you. I'm truly sorry for those moments :(, I'm so grateful to u for loving me, and for always being there and listening to my yap and rants, even when I make things difficult. Thankyousomcuh for letting me feel that i can be loved again. I see how much you care. Thank you for always being so kind to me, even when I don't deserve it. I love you so much loviee, and I'm sorry if I hurt you in any way my kaycee :< </h1>
